## Overview

Version control software helps researchers track and document code development and is essential for combining the work of groups developing on the 
same code base. A very popular and open source version control software is Git and will be introduced through the use of the online code 
repository [Github][github]. Participants will have the opportunity to contribute to an open source project using git and Github.

* Location: [1030 NCSA][ncsa_map]
* Topic: Git Version Control Overview

## Lightning Research Talk

The development of state-of-the-art simulation model that self-consistently couple the electronic and phonon transport is essential in creating a 
cycle that will push designs to have lower carbon footprints and in creating environmentally conscious electronics that  minimize waste. We provide 
a quick primer on the physics of nanoelectronic devices as well as some of the key challenges faced.
